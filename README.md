# Data Science Project Portfolio

## Project 1: Multivariate Analysis of Data Science Job Salaries
This project was completed in R and the report was produced using R Markdown.
#### Project overview
* The data set contains several hundred Data Science-related job listings in the United
States scraped from the website Glassdoor. The purpose of this research was to determine
which of a particular subset of explanatory variables had an effect on the Lower,
Upper, and Average salaries of the jobs. 1-way and 2-way MANOVA, multivariate linear
regression, and testing for nested models was used to identify the best explanatory
variables for a model. After selecting a model, Cookâ€™s distance and normality of residuals
were tested to verify the appropriateness of the model. The results were that the
Sector, Location and Size of the company advertising the jobs were good predictors of
Upper and Lower salaries. This information could be used by any person seeking a job
in this field in the United States who wants to maximize their salary.
